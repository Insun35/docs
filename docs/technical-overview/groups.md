# Groups

InterRep allows users to join groups based on membership in external groups, based on specific properties of the user's identity, or based on reputation gained on social networks. Groups are basically sets of identity commitments related to users and organized as Merkle trees.

What makes these groups extremely useful is the fact that users can prove that they belong to them without revealing their identity. This is possible thanks to the use of so-called ZK-Snarks and Semaphore. So let's see how InterRep can enable this interesting feature and how all these technologies are used.

:::info
In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) is a tree in which every "leaf" (node) is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every node that is not a leaf (called a branch, inner node, or inode) is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes.
